00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040



00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.210
In this video, we'll create our first angler application and


00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.489
investigate its structure.


00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.680
So in a command window, let's navigate to the desktop


00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.990



00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.440
and we'll create the new application with command N G


00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.399
U with D one as the name of the application.


00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.470
And when we're asked any


00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.150
questions, we just accept the default value.


00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.280
But in return, and this might take quite a while but


00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.479
eventually it will complete.


00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.470



00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.509
Now we can see the D1 folder has been created


00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.070



00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.100
so we can navigate into that and we can actually already


00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.500
run the application by the command N G serve.


00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.660
So by default, it creates a fully running Angler application


00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.800
which when it's running, we can inspect by putting in the


00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.110
browser at local host and port 4200


00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.880



00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.050
and we can see the default application in the browser.


00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.040



00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.849
So now let's have a look at the code structure.


00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.430
First of all, we'll look into the source folder


00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.530



00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:24.300
where we see the file index dot html.


00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.600



00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:32.990
It's a fairly standard HTML template except for this tag,


00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:34.639
which is one we won't have seen before.


00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.460
But this is our first example of an angular component


00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:40.900
where the component is the main


00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.190
building block of an angler application.


00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.980
Now, all component source code is found in the APP sub


00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.040
folder of source.


00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.850
Let's look first at the APP component dot T S file will be


00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.400
specified the selector as app dot root matching the tag


00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.449
used in index at html.


00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.850



00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.530
So anywhere where we see the appro tag and group will


00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.259
inject the output from the appro component.


00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.790
Now, in this component, it's setting a variable called title


00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.979
to the value D one.


00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.140
And if you look at the components html file, we find the


00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.280
code that specifies that default


00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.699
page that appears in the browser.


00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.450



00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.020
Now we're gonna throw all that code away and replace it


00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.460
with a much more simple example.


00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.560
It has a head in one element with a welcome message


00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.270
that uses the value of that title variable.


00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.520



00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.870
Now, if we see that and go back and check the browser,


00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.680
we can see that when it refreshes, we get the message.


00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.039
Welcome to D 1 or D1 was the value of title


00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.540



00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.310
again. Just to show how that works.


00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.640
We'll go back and change the message to say welcome


00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.630
to my D one.


00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.280
And we can see the browser has already updated now


00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.559
as well as the typescript and html files.


00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.500
A component can also have a style sheet file.


00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.690
So let's define a CS S rule for the head in one element


00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.170
and we'll set the text color to red and the background


00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.230
color to yellow again when we save that and check in the


00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.360
browser, we can see our heading one element now


00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.720
defined in that style.


00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.470
