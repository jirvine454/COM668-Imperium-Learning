00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180



00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.940
So in this video, we'll add a


00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.389
component of our own to our simple application.


00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.880
Now, we know that component is made up of three files,


00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.869
that's one html, one CS S and one typescript.


00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.940
So let's create a component for our collection of


00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
businesses by creating the files, businesses dot


00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.370
component dot html, businesses dot component dot T S


00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.520
and businesses dot component dot CS S now R html file


00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.150
will be the output of the component.


00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.020
So again, we'll have a simple heading. One element, we


00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.029
leave the stylesheet file empty for now.


00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.740
And in the typescript file, the easiest thing to do is to


00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.280
copy the contents of our


00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.009
app dot component typescript file


00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.460



00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:49.750
and we'll change the selector to businesses


00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.830



00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.340
which means the template URL


00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.110
and the style your rails to match.


00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.010



00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.290
We'll update the class name and we'll just remove the


00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.410
contents of the class.


00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.590



00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:11.690
Now, in our app dot component html file, we'll add a


00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.900
businesses tag to inject the output of the new component


00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.010
onto the web page.


00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.720
So if we save those files and check it out in the browser,


00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.370
we can see we've got no output.


00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.910



00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.639
But if we display a browser console


00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.870
and click through that.


00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.860
And different browsers will display this in a slightly


00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.330
different way, but we should be able to see the nature of


00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.430
the error message.


00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.430
Businesses is not a known element.


00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.590



00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:45.040
And what we need to do is register our new component


00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.010
with the application now because we added our


00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.160
businesses tag to the app dot component html file.


00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.120
We need to import


00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.709
the business component into the app component.


00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.100



00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.400
Also in the main application file app dot module, we need


00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.649
to import the new component in the same way.


00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.670



00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.780
And we also need to add it to our declarations list


00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.919
alongside the existing app component.


00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.820
Now that we've done that we can go back to the browser


00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.860
and we can see the output of our new businesses


00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.929
component has been.


00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.930
